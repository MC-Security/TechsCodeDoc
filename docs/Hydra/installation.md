# Installation

Hydra can be used for a single Minecraft Server as well as for multiple. If you are planning on syncing menus you will need to have a MySQL Database.

## Regular Install

Install [ProtocolLib](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/protocollib.1997/) by downloading it and dropping it in your plugins directory.
Drop your `Hydra.jar` into your plugins directory and restart your server.

You will need to have the ``hydra.admin`` permission to use Hydra.

If you have this you should be able to open Hydra via `/hydra`.

## Network Install

Connect Hydra to your MySQL Database by navigation to (``/hydra > MySQL > Enable``). You'll be prompted to fill in all necessary information about your database. Once you've filled everything in and restarted your server, you'll now be able to save GUI's and Commands in your MySQL.
