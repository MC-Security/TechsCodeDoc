# Installation

Hydra can be used for a single Minecraft Server as well as for multiple. If you are planning on syncing menus you will need to have a MySQL Database.

## Regular Install

Drop your `Hydra.jar` into your plugins directory and restart your server.

To use Hydra you will need to be OP or have the '*' permission.

If you have this you should be able to open Hydra via `/hydra`.

## Network Install

Connect Hydra to your MYSQL Database via the MYSQL Database button in the main menu. You'll be promoted to fill in all nessecary information about your database. Once you've filled everything in and restarted your server, you'll now be able to creates menus using MYSQL.
